A web-based basic calculator is an interactive application that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using HTML for structuring the interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, allowing users to input numbers and operators, process calculations, and display results dynamically on a browser. Typically, this application resides entirely on the front-end, making it lightweight and easily accessible online. Its simplicity makes it an excellent beginner-friendly project in web development.
